 * a connection on it. Once a connection has been received, reads the data from it and
 * parses the file names out of the data buffer. Each file name is copied to a new string
 * and then enqueued to the files queue.
 * If the enqueue operation fails (returns 0), the copier is application to exit and therefore
 * the Listener thread should stop. Before stopping, it should remove the pipe file and
 * free the memory of the filename it failed to enqueue.

 * Copier thread starting point.
 * The copier reads file names from the files queue, one by one, and copies them to the
 * destination directory as given to the main function. Then it should free the memory of
 * the dequeued file name string (it was allocated by the Listener thread).
 * If the dequeue operation fails (returns NULL), it means that the application is trying
 * to exit and therefore the thread should simply terminate.

/*
 * Main function.
 * Reads command line arguments in the format:
 * 		./Copier pipe_name destination_dir
 * Where pipe_name is the name of FIFO pipe that the Listener should create and
 * destination_dir is the path to the destination directory that the copier should
 * copy files into.
 * This function should create the files queue and prepare the parameters to the Listener and
 * Copier threads. Then, it should create these threads.
 * After threads are created, this function should control them as follows:
 * it should read input from user, and if the input line is EXIT_CMD (defined above), it should
 * set the files queue as "finished". This should make the threads terminate (possibly only
 * when the next connection is received).
 * At the end the function should join the threads and exit.
